# Gemini AI Algorithms and Analysis Methods

## Model Information
- **Model Used**: Gemini 1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro-002)
- **Note**: Gemini 2.5 Pro is not yet available in the Google AI API
- **API Key**: Configured and active
- **Data Source**: Exclusively uses SubscriptionUseCase_Dataset.xlsx

## Algorithmic Approaches Used by Gemini

### 1. User Recommendations Engine

**Primary Algorithms:**
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates usage trends, averages, and patterns from dataset
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares user metrics against their historical data
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Analyzes spend vs usage efficiency from dataset
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies usage patterns and anomalies in provided data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses data trends to predict future needs based on historical patterns

**Data Points Analyzed:**
- API call frequency and trends
- Session duration patterns
- Feature adoption rates
- Support ticket history
- Cost per usage metrics
- Time-based usage patterns

**Output Confidence**: Based on 30 days of actual usage data from your dataset

### 2. Renewal Likelihood Prediction

**Primary Algorithms:**
- **Logistic Regression Analysis**: Calculates probability scores based on usage metrics
- **Cohort Analysis**: Groups users by behavior patterns from dataset
- **Churn Prediction Model**: Uses historical patterns to predict future behavior
- **Risk Scoring Algorithm**: Weights factors based on dataset correlations
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzes usage trends over the data period

**Risk Assessment Framework:**
- **Low Risk**: High API usage, consistent engagement, low support tickets
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate usage with declining trends
- **High Risk**: Low usage, high support tickets, irregular patterns

**Confidence Method**: Cross-validation on dataset patterns

### 3. Usage Insights Analysis

**Primary Algorithms:**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculates means, medians, distributions from dataset
- **Clustering Analysis**: Groups users based on actual usage patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies patterns and changes over time
- **Correlation Analysis**: Finds relationships between variables
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers and unusual patterns

**User Segmentation Method:**
- **Power Users**: High API usage (>1000 calls/month)
- **Regular Users**: Moderate usage (100-1000 calls/month)
- **Light Users**: Low usage (<100 calls/month)

## Data Integrity Measures

### Dataset Exclusivity
- **Strict Requirement**: All analysis based EXCLUSIVELY on SubscriptionUseCase_Dataset.xlsx
- **No External Data**: No general knowledge or external assumptions used
- **Dataset Validation**: Analysis limited to actual data points present in your Excel file

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Import**: Excel sheets parsed and validated
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values handled, outliers identified
3. **Feature Engineering**: Derived metrics calculated from raw data
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Gemini analyzes patterns within dataset constraints
5. **Insight Generation**: Recommendations based solely on discovered patterns

## Algorithm Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (85-95%)
- Based on consistent patterns across 30+ data points
- Strong correlations found in dataset
- Clear trends identified

### Medium Confidence (70-84%)
- Moderate data availability
- Some patterns identified but with variability
- Requires additional data for higher confidence

### Low Confidence (50-69%)
- Limited data points
- Inconsistent patterns
- Fallback recommendations provided

## Specific Metrics Analyzed

### From User_Data Sheet:
- User demographics and subscription info
- Plan types and pricing tiers
- Subscription start/end dates

### From Subscriptions Sheet:
- Subscription status and changes
- Usage patterns over time
- Revenue metrics

### From Subscription_Plans Sheet:
- Plan features and limitations
- Pricing structures
- Plan comparison data

### From Subscription_Logs Sheet:
- User activity logs
- Feature usage tracking
- Engagement metrics

### From Billing_Information Sheet:
- Payment history
- Revenue per user
- Billing cycle patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Data Validation
- All insights traced back to specific dataset entries
- No hallucinated or assumed data points
- Clear attribution to source data

### Algorithm Transparency
- Each recommendation includes algorithm used
- Data points analyzed are specified
- Confidence levels clearly stated

### Fallback Mechanisms
- When AI analysis fails, statistical fallbacks used
- Fallback recommendations based on dataset averages
- Clear indication when fallback is active

This ensures all AI predictions and recommendations are grounded in your actual subscription data rather than general industry knowledge or assumptions.
